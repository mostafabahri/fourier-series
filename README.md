# Fourier Series

A Fourier series is a way to represent a function as the sum of simple sine waves.   
This project implements a Fourier series summation in both numeric and symbolic forms for value `x` on function `f(x)`.   

For CSS, [Bulma](http://bulma.io/) is used and for DOM manipulation [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
